    <h2>Game Story</h2>
      <p>The snow bunnies of the Frost Tribe once peacefully lived in their world of ice. They were peaceful, snowflake-like creatures who were granted eternal life and rebirth as long as their snowy homeland survived. </p>
      <p> They had a long history of rivalry and intermittent war with the creatures of fire. In the past, the fire tribe had committed many atrocities against them, and many snowflakes had gone through hardship. Some had even lost their lives when part of the land lost its snow.
</p>
      <p>Once again, the creatures of fire, mortal enemies of the ice, became jealous of the utopia of the snow, upheld for many generations despite the hardship and wars. They had a hatred of snow and knew their powers and life force would be strengthened if they expanded their territory by getting rid of the snowy land.
 </p>
      <p>They attacked and began melting the city. Initially, they were only able to attack from afar due to the snow being their natural downfall, but eventually found a method to resist this and directly invade, turning the tide of war. 
 </p>
      <p>However, the snowflakes, which float through the air, lack the training and finesse to properly attack the invaders in an organized manner, and are often at the mercy of the wind. This is where a mystical, long-rumored deity, the wind god, comes in. </p>
      <p>The Frost Tribe now needs you, the player and wind god, who has special powers of wind manipulation. You must guide their soldiers towards the fire in order to stave off the melting and ultimate destruction of their land. 
 </p>
    <h2>How Players Can Identify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The story helps players identify with the game by making them the hero and providing an overall goal - to defeat the fire invaders and keep the snowflakes/snow tribe from being killed, and their world from being destroyed.</li>
        <li>The player is the only one who can do this, since he has special wind-manipulating powers to help the snowflake soldiers hit their targets.
</li>
        <li>The player can relate because he, too, has a survival instinct and would not want to be killed in a war, nor have his homeland destroyed.
</li>
        <li>The snowflakes and fire-creatures are to some extent anthropomorphized and have human emotions such as anger, fear, jealousy, and nationalism, which helps the player relate to them.
</li>
        <li>The player already understands that fire and ice/snow are not something that can easily coexist, so the conflict makes sense intuitively.
</li>
        <li>Having fire/heat as the enemy makes it easy to understand as fire is generally known to be destructive, with snow being perceived as more peaceful.
</li>
        <li>The fire’s lack of rationale for attacking makes it easier to disagree with as a player. By lacking reason and simply being a force of destruction the player can easily identify them as evil.
</li>
        <li>The fire is also the one invading someone else, and lacks magnanimity, having feelings of jealousy which are seen as unappealing and undesired.
</li>
        <li>The snow however, has the benefit of being attacked, appealing to feelings of protection in the player.
</li>
      </ul>
  
  <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Adventure time</strong> - Character inspiration for enemy characters and overall feel of the game.  The Ice king's snowy castle and the Flame princess flame visualization. </em></li>


      <li><em><strong>Plants vs.Zombies</strong> - The idea of making waves came from this game. Our idea is to make the flames the enemies and as the game progress the waves get bigger. If they defeat all the waves then the progress to the next level. </em></li>


      <li><em><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</strong> - One of our ideas was to make colorful flames come out of the boxes and sort each snowflake based on it color.  But that idea shifted to something more interactive.</em></li>
    </ul>
  
  <h1>Primal Branding</h1>
    <h2>Creation Story</h2>
      <p>
      It was a merry day in the world of Aggieland. The days were not yet cold and the humid air gave warmth and passion to our souls. It was on that historic day that our team, the Red Machina, was born. It was then that we knew what we needed to do. Create a game that represented the struggle, the cold war of life, of ice and fire, and a player representation of the winds of fate that brought us together.
      </p>
    <h2>Creed</h2>
      <p>
      As laid out previously, we want to develop games that will immerse the user in gameplay, making them compelling in design, story, and feel. Thus, our company needs to be technologically aware to new changes so we can use these advances in our product. In order to be hired in our company the individual has to have passion, motivation, and has to love playing games.  Of course these qualities intangible and are not identifiable when our eyes. Thus we would look for past projects to identify such qualities. Artists of course are welcome and urged to join our team with any game design experience. 
      </p>
    <h2>Icons</h2>
      <p>
      For our icons, they would primarily be the design of the snowflakes as well as the fire monsters. These icons, or pieces of art, will be what the user will be most familiar with after playing the game. They are the primary objects of concern when playing the game, as you will be handling the snowflakes and aiming for the fire monsters.For our icons, they would primarily be the design of the snowflakes as well as the fire monsters.

      </p>
    <h2>Rituals</h2>
      <p>
      The ‘rituals’ of the game include defeating fire through the use of various powers of snow. KILL ALL WHO OPPOSE
You get satisfaction out of ritualistically killing your enemies using well-timed and coordinated finger-swipes. Bonus points if you use snowflakes.
</p>
    <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>
      Be familiar with the language of the snow tribe. Avoid saying anything fire related.
      </p>
    <h2>Anti-Believers</h2>
      <p>
      Anybody that does not believe in the company's mission and ideals will become isolated from the company. Eventually leading to permanent termination. We want people that are driven and passionate and if they are not willing to have that in their hearts then they should disappear from our premises.
      </p>
    <h2>Leader</h2>
      <p>
      Wendo, the God of the Winds, who guides the snowflakes on their way to destroying the beings of fire. You are likely a third party, neither a snowflake nor a fire that enters into the conflict and decides to guide and defend the people of ice.
