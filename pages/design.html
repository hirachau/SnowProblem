  <h1>Design</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Snow Problem is an action game where you twirl and flick snowflakes into your fiery enemies in the midst of a magical winter world. It's built for portability and uses the touchscreen exactly as you'd expect. Try your best to get a high score in time!</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>In the main experience of this game, you'll find yourself plunged into the middle of a lonely and beautiful winterland - colored fire, snowflakes falling, and with soothing and slightly eerie background music to boot. Your objective? Use the touchscreen to swirl and flick the snowflakes into the correctly colored flames to weaken the threat to our peaceful winter...or something. Let's face it, you're actually doing it because it's fun. </p>
      <p>You'll get points for matching up colors correctly and lose them for bad aim. It's simple enough, but surprisingly, is capable of drawing you in. You can control the trajectory of the snowflakes with simple flicks and drags of your finger, but be careful: it can be harder than it looks. You wouldn't want your score to go negative...
</p>
      <p>In addition, there are various other enhancements, features and modes planned for addition later on as development continues, to make the experience even more fun, so look forward to it. And development will continue for bug-fixes and improvements on a regular basis. Meanwhile, though, you'll have the core experience to keep you occupied.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplicity and a clean, sharply contrasting look</li>
        <li>Easy to pick up, hard to master
</li>
        <li>Use your fingers to blow snowflakes in arcs and spirals, sending them careening into the flames</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
      <p>This is a casual action game with an artistic and fantastical twist, meant to make your idle time feel less dreary.</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
      <p>Meant for a touch screen, this game is initially being developed for Android but has the potential to be ported to any touchscreen platform, potentially even Windows. There is currently no multiplayer support, but a future update may include online leaderboards.</p>
    <h2>Concept Art</h2>
      <img src = "../images/placeholder.jpg">
      <p>[A little bit of art helps sell the idea and puts the readers in the right frame of mind. Use art to convey unique or complex ideas. Screen mock-ups go a long way to express your vision. ]</p>
    <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
      <p>[Try to avoid pure guesses on numbers. Look for info on the Internet (www.gamestats.com is a good source) and use existing hits in the same genre as indicators for market performance.

    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
      <p>[The technical analysis should be written by a seasoned programmer, preferably the technical director or a lead programmer, and then edited and compiled into the proposal.]</p>
    <h2>Cost and Revenue Projections</h2>
      <p>[The cost and revenue projections can be done in conjunction with the finance and purchasing departments. This data should give the reader a rough estimate of resource costs based on the technical analysis's estimated resources.]</p>
