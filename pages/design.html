  <h1>Design</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Snow Problem is an action game where you twirl and flick snowflakes into your fiery enemies in the midst of a magical winter world. It's built for portability and uses the touchscreen exactly as you'd expect. Try your best to get a high score in time!</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>In the main experience of this game, you'll find yourself plunged into the middle of a lonely and beautiful winterland - colored fire, snowflakes falling, and with soothing and slightly eerie background music to boot. Your objective? Use the touchscreen to swirl and flick the snowflakes into the correctly colored flames to weaken the threat to our peaceful winter...or something. Let's face it, you're actually doing it because it's fun. </p>
      <p>You'll get points for matching up colors correctly and lose them for bad aim. It's simple enough, but surprisingly, is capable of drawing you in. You can control the trajectory of the snowflakes with simple flicks and drags of your finger, but be careful: it can be harder than it looks. You wouldn't want your score to go negative...
</p>
      <p>In addition, there are various other enhancements, features and modes planned for addition later on as development continues, to make the experience even more fun, so look forward to it. And development will continue for bug-fixes and improvements on a regular basis. Meanwhile, though, you'll have the core experience to keep you occupied.</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplicity and a clean, sharply contrasting look</li>
        <li>Easy to pick up, hard to master
</li>
        <li>Use your fingers to blow snowflakes in arcs and spirals, sending them careening into the flames</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
      <p>This is a casual action game with an artistic and fantastical twist, meant to make your idle time feel less dreary.</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
      <p>Meant for a touch screen, this game is initially being developed for Android but has the potential to be ported to any touchscreen platform, potentially even Windows. There is currently no multiplayer support, but a future update may include online leaderboards.</p>

    <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
      <p>
      Assuming a released game to Android via Unity we intend to follow the easy freemium model of advertisements to generate revenue. In similar markets, other FTP (free to play) games now make up 94% of the market on Android (VentureBeat). Let it also be noted that of apps downloaded, 40% are games. With Android's sizeable market share, we expect that Snow Problem should have plenty of users to draw from. That being said however, because we are an unknown developer and have no current plans for advertising this product, I believe based on personal experience that estimations such as Forbes, cited below can overshoot due to behemoths such as Clash of Clans and Pokemon Go generating millions in revenue. A likely estimate would be within the range of $10-100 a few months after release.</p>
    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
      <p> The game consists mainly of three core components: the snowflakes, the enemies and the

overall game controller itself.</p>
<p>
The game controller determines the spawn locations of both enemies and snowflakes

and generates the colours of the two. The more of a certain colour enemy on screen, the more

likely a colour of snowflake will be generated to match it. The game controller also keeps track

of the score and time, updating the UI accordingly. Once the time reaches nill, a call is made to

load the high-score menu.
</p>
<p>
The Snowflakes are controlled by a fall script determining location prior to being

interacted with by the user. The user interacts by putting their finger on the screen, generating a

'ray-cast' or straight line from the user's finger through the z axis to determine if any objects are

hit along the way. Assuming an object is hit, an invisible spring is generated at the point of the

user's touch and anchored to the object hit. Until the user releases their finger from the screen

the spring will continue to drag the object to wherever the user points their finger. Upon release,

the object is granted extra velocity in the z direction and unlocked to fly towards any fire.
</p>
<p>
The enemies are controlled by three different possible AI scripts at random on

generation. One iteration has the enemy zig-zag, another has them stand still and the final one

will simply make the enemy move back and forth in a straight line. From there it is a simple

matter of whether the enemy detects a collision with the same colour snowflake, if it does both

objects are deleted and points are increased. If a snowflake of incorrect colour is detected, the

snowflake is deleted, and points are decreased.
</p>
    <h2>Cost and Revenue Projections</h2>
      <p>Cost at this point is minimal, as all members have worked in free time/school time on a

volunteer basis, no cash was provided, but rather a share in the creation of the game. Revenue,

as noted by the aforementioned Market Analysis is minimal, but will net higher than the total

cost of assets (~$28). If all projections are correct the game would net around a 75% gain,

excluding depreciation and market degradation the app could continue to generate revenue for

a good many years to come.</p>
